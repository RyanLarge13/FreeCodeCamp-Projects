            <h2>Basic Principals</h2>
            </header>
            <p>There are three massively important principals that you will need to live by as a gym enthusiest.
                <ul>
                    <li>Waking up early</li>
                    <li>Eating a <strong>TON</strong> of <em>PROTEIN</em></li>
                    <li>And lastly... Diligence</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>When you follow these basic principals every single day with diligence you will begin to
               see a quick difference iin your look and performance. Proteins are the building blocks of the body and 
               muscular tissue. You must consume 1.5kg per pound of bodyweight daily. For example.. <code>
                   if {Y=100} {then x=150}
               </code> Don't forget to wake up every mornin 
               at <time>6am</time>.

            <h2>Defining A Goal</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Next, lets turn our focus onto defining a goal for ourselves. There are three questions we need
                to be asking ourselves before we dive into working out everyday. This is so we can stay passionate and 
                diligent about our goals and never lose sight of what we truly desire to keep that flame inside burning 
                alive and hot!<code>if {Y=Happy} then {X=Healthy}</code>
             </p>
             <p><strong>Questions to ask ourselves.....</strong> 
                 <ol>
                     <li><q>What physuiqe am I striving for?</q></li>
                     <li><q>What are my dietary restrictions?</q></li>
                     <li>And..... <q>Do I have support from family and friends?</q></li>
                 </ol>

            <header>
            <h2>Diets</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Last but not least we have finally arrived to diets. Where you able to answer the questions up above?
                if so and the answer was none, then lets dive into the three micro nutrients and cover what they do.
             </p>
             <h3>Micros</h3>
             <ul>
                 <li>Fats</li>
                 <li>Proteins</li>
                 <li>Carbs</li>
             </ul>
             <h4>Fats</h4>
             <p><code>1g fat = 8 calories</code> Fats are esssential, no matter what people say. fats give long term very abundant and strong energy 
                they do great for long periods of heavy endurance training. 
             </p>
             <h4>Proteins</h4>
             <p><code>1g protein = 4 calories</code> Proteins are a fantastic way to build muscle.<strong>Eat a lot of them!!!!</strong>. They are the
             building blocks of your muscles and will help you heal and grow much bigger!</p>
             <h4>Carbs</h4>
             <p><code>1g carbs = 4 calories</code> Carbs are a gift from god himself. Keto diet enthusiests are absolutely bonkerz for having
                anything at all to do with that diet. eat a lot of carbs they supply quick and fast energy for your
                muscles to burn and use up when you are working out and throughout the day. They also help your body from 
                eating its own muscles.
